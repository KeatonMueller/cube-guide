Why would I ever choose to use redux for my small scale application?

Two main reasons:
  1. Familiarity
  2. Performance

I have used redux at work a fair amount, so I feel comfortable using
it and don't mind the boilerplate too much.

Additionally, when researching alternatives (primarily the native useReducer)
I found this reddit post from a redux maintainer:
https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/10uf6vf/to_redux_or_not_to_redux_to_usereducer_or_usestate/j7bzhg3/
The limitation of both passing props and using context causing child components
to re-render is a big thing that I'd like to avoid, so I decided to go with redux.

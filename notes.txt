Remembering how rotation directions result in the cube:
  - Positive X rotation: cube rotates towards you (R')
  - Negative X rotation: cube rotates away from you (R)
  - Positive Y rotation: cube rotates left/counter clockwise (U')
  - Negative Y rotation: cube rotates right/clockwise (U)
  - Positive Z rotation: cube rotates left (F')
  - Negative Z rotation: cube rotates right (F)
So focusing on F, R, U, the rotation direction is the inverse of the cube notation
